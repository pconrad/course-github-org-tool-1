        Uh oh, it looks like we couldn't find you in the course roster! Be sure that
        you have added and verified your university email (i.e. cgaucho@umail.ucsb.edu)
        as an alias to your GitHub account so we can know who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are certain that your university email is attached to your GitHub
        account and has been verified, then you are likely not in the official
        course roster that was uploaded to this website. Perhaps you added the
        course after the roster was uploaded by your instructor. Contact your
        instructor for details about what to do next. Include your github id as
        well as your school email in your inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>For your reference, your current list of emails is shown below:</p>
      <ul>
        <% @emails.each do |email| %>
          <li>
            <%= email['email'] %>
            <% if email['primary'] %>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign text-primary" title="Primary email address"></span>
            <% end %>
            <% if email['verified'] %>
              <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok-sign text-success" title="Verified email address"></span>
